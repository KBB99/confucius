              If university were truly about education, would there not be the opportunity fo an infinite amount of resubmissions? If a student is going to university with the purpose of learning then he should be given multiple opportunities to master a subject. Instead universities decide the future of millions with the purpose of producing the most docile and submissive individuals possible. Now a days most people do not even question the motives behind why they are in university. Like all others, these people float through life without questioning the ultimate goal of what they are living for. Rare is the person who can step back from the path that is being thrust upon them. Not Lu Xun. To paraphrase from Cervantes, he saw the danger that lies in following things for the sake of the way they are and not the way they should be. Today we are all carried away by the current that is modern life. If Lu Xun were alive today what would he do? Would he go to an incredibly expensive college when there is a far superior body of knowledge living on the web? Would he learn out of curiosity or would he only study for the sake of getting a high-paying job? Would he cry out once more or applaud our society. I think that all the answers to these questions are obvious, he would take the fastest path towards gaining knowledge and then work to break down the steel prison of modern life, and try to succeed before we all suffocate in it. He would likely become disgusted with the enormous amount of time that the current system forces people to waste. He would become incredulous at the lack of willpower prevalent among the extremely well-educated youth who know very well of the consequences that will result if they do nothing, yet who all do nothing anyway. If he were alive today he would cry more desperately than he did for the Chinese nation. We must look to Lu Xun for guidance, understand that we are slowly suffocating due to our indifference, and begin dreaming of solving the problem. Of course this is one of the many instances where the system will undercut me for not doing exactly as it demands. Attempting to create something outside the confines of the course will result in my being shot down. What I need, what everyone needs, is the bravery, the self-confidence, to do everything we feel to be truly important and hope we succeed. We must stop questioning the reason we do evverything and instead do everything for something.

Four of the era’s chief protagonists died 100 years earlier: the painters Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele, the architect Otto Wagner and the universal artist Koloman Moser. Each played a leading role in making the fin de siècle period such an important time for art in Vienna and Austria. Klimt and Moser were cofounders of the Vienna Secession – which has remained one of the most important spaces for visual art ever since it first opened. To celebrate the incredible achievements of these exceptional artists, Vienna is not only devoting a year-long series of exhibitions and events to them 100 years down the line, but has also set up this page as a digital Secession. A place where you can immerse yourself in the era in which they lived and interact with the artists themselves. You will soon see that all four of them had one thing in common: they were ahead of their time. Their work set new standards and continues to inspire people all over the world to this day.","about.discover":"Find out more about these personalities, experiment, and discover the Zeitgeist that defined Viennese Modernism.","about.slogan.1":"Be ahead of","about.slogan.2":"your","about.slogan.3":"time.","about.slogan.4":"   ","about.landingpagelink":"Discover more","books.order-now":"Order now","books.title":"Booktips","books.shareTitle":"Booktips","books.shareDescription":"Read about Viennese Modernism","events.permanent":"Permanent Exhibition","events.title":"Plan ahead - Event Calendar ","events.shareTitle":"Plan ahead","events.shareDescription":"to the Event Calendar","fashion.title":"Viennese fashion","fashion.shareTitle":"A city influences the world of fashion","fashion.shareDescription":"Vienna and Viennese Modernism continue to inspire artists and designers all over the world.","fashion.tweet":"Vienna and Viennese Modernism: A city inspires world of fashion. #ViennaNow","fashion.headline_line1":"Get inspired","fashion.headline_line2":"by Vienna","fashion.paragraph-1":"Vienna and Viennese Modernism continue to inspire artists and designers all over the world.

But that changed once the ophthalmologist Rudolf Leopold (1925-2010) started collecting his works in the 1950s. Egon Schiele’s (1890-1918) standing – and with it the prices for his paintings and sketches – rose virtually overnight. Today he is ranked among the most important expressionists of them all. The world’s largest and most significant collection of his works can be seen at the Leopold Museum, which was founded by husband-and-wife art collectors Rudolf and Elisabeth Leopold. More than 40 paintings and around 190 works on paper can be seen there alongside countless other examples of Viennese Modernism – from Gustav Klimt to Wiener Werkstätte.\nIn an interview Elisabeth Leopold talks about Egon Schiele’s controversial œuvre as well as the painter Gustav Klimt and his influence on the young expressionist.","elisabeth-leopold.portrait_1.caption":"Elisabeth Leopold next to Schiele’s Portrait of Wally (1912) at the Leopold Museum ","elisabeth-leopold.portrait_1.copyright":"© Leopold Museum/APA-Fotoservice/Ian Ehm","elisabeth-leopold.painting_1.caption":"Egon Schiele, The Hermits, 1912","elisabeth-leopold.painting_1.copyright":"© Leopold Museum, Vienna","elisabeth-leopold.question_1":"Dr. Leopold, what is likeable about Schiele?","elisabeth-leopold.answer_1":"His absoluteness. His stubbornness. Which I also saw in Rudolf Leopold.","elisabeth-leopold.question_2":"Were there any similarities between the two?","elisabeth-leopold.answer_2":"I couldn’t say. We didn’t know Schiele. But perhaps they were similar, as far as persistence went. After all, my husband would not deviate from the line he took. When he began to collect Schiele’s works, people poked fun at him. But he continued anyway.","elisabeth-leopold.question_3":"How did you first come into contact with Schiele’s œuvre?","elisabeth-leopold.answer_3":"Through my husband. The first Schiele picture that I saw was the gouache version of the Tote Stadt (Dead Town). Impressive. Each building had a face. Schiele made the buildings appear “frail”. Half of the plaster work has crumbled away. It is what we call ugliness. But I am now so used to it that a freshly painted house is anathema to me. Not a single line on this picture is drawn with a ruler. Everything is in flux, everything is floating. That accounts for its lively, dreamlike qualities. My husband bought the picture in 1950.","elisabeth-leopold.question_4":"What was it about Schiele that fascinated your husband?","elisabeth-leopold.answer_4":"His brilliance as a draftsman. In my view, Schiele was the best sketch artist of the twentieth century.","elisabeth-leopold.question_5":"What was Schiele’s standing at the start of the twentieth century?","elisabeth-leopold.answer_5":"He was unknown. His works were bought by a couple of collectors such as Heinrich Benesch, Carl Reininghaus, Oskar Reichel and Arthur Roessler. Schiele came to their attention in 1909 at Gustav Pisko’s gallery in Vienna at the first exhibition of the Neukunstgruppe, which was founded by Schiele and various other artists.","elisabeth-leopold.question_6":"You once described Schiele as the “bugbear of society” …","elisabeth-leopold.answer_6.1":"I would almost go so far as to say that Schiele hit like a meteor. Especially his nudes from 1910. We have one of his most interesting oil paintings here at the Leopold Museum: \nthe “yellow nude”","elisabeth-leopold.answer_6.2":"1","elisabeth-leopold.answer_6.3":".  It continues to unsettle people to this day. Clearly a person this yellow is hardly beautiful. But it shows visitors how energetically drawn the lines are and how fantastically this figure floats in a space similarly devoid of air.","elisabeth-leopold.question_7":"How great was Gustav Klimt’s influence on Schiele, in reality?","elisabeth-leopold.answer_7":"Klimt became the uncrowned king of the artists in Vienna with the foundation of the Secession in 1897, at the very latest. He invented Viennese Jugendstil. And as a portraitist to the rich he was a darling of society. But he also had a place in his heart for the younger generation. He once said “The young are brushing me aside. And that’s the way it should be.” He invited Schiele and Kokoschka to the Kunstschau exhibitions. That was an act of greatness. And Klimt also gave Schiele great support after his time in prison.","elisabeth-leopold.question_8":"That was in 1912 …","elisabeth-leopold.answer_8":"Yes, Schiele’s most productive year.","elisabeth-leopold.question_9":"Why was 1912 such an important year?","elisabeth-leopold.answer_9.1":"He moved to Neulengbach in Lower Austria at the end of 1911. He felt extremely at ease there. And it was here that his burst of creativity began. Incarceration","elisabeth-leopold.answer_9.2":"2","elisabeth-leopold.answer_9.3":" interrupted his creative flow. But his powers gradually returned after his release. And who should cross his path? Klimt. He helped him get back on his feet and recommended him to one of his major patrons, August Lederer","elisabeth-leopold.answer_9.4":"3","elisabeth-leopold.answer_9.5":". That was Mr. Klimt’s greatest gesture. Klimt felt a kind of paternal love towards Schiele. And Schiele was incredibly grateful to Klimt.","elisabeth-leopold.question_10":"What is Schiele’s main work in your view?","elisabeth-leopold.answer_10":"\"The Hermits\", which he painted out of grati­tude to Gustav Klimt. The picture shows these two figures, people of emotion, who are supporting each other, but sooner or later must collapse, under a barren sky in a cold world. There is a letter from Schiele about this painting, in which he writes: “It arose from pure ardency.” That is just wonderful.","elisabeth-leopold.painting_2.caption":"Egon Schiele, Seated Male Nude (self-portrait), 1910","elisabeth-leopold.painting_2.copyright":"© Leopold Museum, Vienna ","elisabeth-leopold.question_11":"Death is a recurrent theme for Schiele. Was he melancholic?","elisabeth-leopold.answer_11":"I don’t think so. He reminds me of Mozart a little: an incredible genius, but childishly naive, ironic and a little nasty. When visiting Arthur Roessler at Lake Traunsee he brought some giant wooden crates with him containing a model railway. He set it up, even making the various noises while playing with it. His fondness for model railways stemmed from his childhood. His father was a stationmaster.","elisabeth-leopold.question_16":"In his short life – he only lived to the ageof 28 – Egon Schiele produced more than 350 paintings and around 2,800 watercolors and sketches. What drove him?","elisabeth-leopold.answer_16":"As a matter of fact, he was very hard work­ing. He was passionate about his creations, and was compulsive.","elisabeth-leopold.question_17":"Can you see any contemporary artists who could end up assuming a similar significance to Schiele?","elisabeth-leopold.answer_17":"Anselm Kiefer is a very interesting contemporary painter. I find his subject matter important, such as his treatment of the Shoah. It is not possible to mourn enough over the Holocaust.","elisabeth-leopold.footnotes.1":"Seated Male Nude (self-portrait)","elisabeth-leopold.footnotes.2":"From April 13, 1912 Schiele spent 24 days in prison awaiting trial on suspicion of “endangering public morality and outraging public decency”.","elisabeth-leopold.footnotes.3":"August Lederer was an Austrian industrialist, collector and patron of the arts who chiefly backed Gustav Klimt.","eric-kandel.portrait_1.copyright":"© WienTourismus/Rainer Fehringer","eric-kandel.title.headline":"“We should really go below the surface”","eric-kandel.title.author.label":"by: ","eric-kandel.title.author.name.1":"Stefan Müller","eric-kandel.title.author.name.2":"\u0026 Robert Seydel","eric-kandel.title.introduction":"Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel talks about Viennese Modernism, his preoccupation with the magic of this era and the bite of contemporary werewolves.","eric-kandel.paragraph_1":"Celebrated like a rock star in scientific circles, Eric Kandel is one of the most important brain researchers of the twentieth century. In 2000 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his pioneering work on how memories are stored in the brain. Even at a ripe old age Eric Kandel, who was born in Vienna in 1929, is still an avid researcher and maintains a strong interest in art. The years of Viennese Modernism continue to have a strong hold over him: because it was then that modern research took its first steps into unlocking the secrets of the mind and artists also played a hand in exploring the fundamental principles of thought. In 2012 he published a book entitled The Age of Insight which was devoted to “The Quest to Understand the Unconscious in Art, Mind, and Brain, from Vienna 1900 to the Present”(subtitle).","eric-kandel.question_1":"Mr. Kandel, when was the last time you fell in love with a painting?","eric-kandel.answer_1":"Oh my god, I fall in love with paintings all the time. My wife and I have a wonderful collection, we buy art all the time. We picked up a gorgeous Nolde just a few weeks ago.","eric-kandel.question_2":"On a neurological level now, is it actually possible to fall in love with a painting like the 14-year-old Ronald Lauder did with Klimt’s picture of Adele Bloch-Bauer?","eric-kandel.answer_2":"Of course it is. You can fall in love with a book, or with wine. You can fall in love with many things. It is not necessarily erotic as it would be between human beings. You get nothing back. But there’s a pleasurable aspect of really liking something.","eric-kandel.question_3":"You also collect Viennese Modernist art …",

And I have several Kokoschkas, including one that was in the Klimt/Schiele/Kokoschka and the Women exhibition at the Belvedere. ","eric-kandel.question_4":"What was special about that time?","eric-kandel.answer_4":"The Ringstrasse was being built. Vienna was moving and becoming one the most beautiful cities in Europe. Franz Joseph had passed a decree in 1867 declaring that all religions were equal. So the people could travel around the empire. A great many young, ambitious and gifted Jews came to Vienna. And they supported Klimt, Kokoschka and Schiele in a very important way, by having their children and their wives painted by them.","eric-kandel.question_5":"The artists played their part in the discovery of the unconscious, you say. What was their contribution?","eric-kandel.answer_5":"They all attempted to portray the unconscious – Kokoschka and Schiele in particular. “I discovered the unconscious independently of Freud,” Kokoschka said. There’s no doubt that he was strongly influenced by Freud.","eric-kandel.paragraph_2":"A light goes off for Kandel: now we have mentioned the name of the man that influenced him, too. The artists put desires, sexuality and emotion on canvas, which Freud had identified as the subconscious drivers behind human behavior. Freud wanted to find out more about the brain. And because he lacked the necessary technical means, he started out by designing a theory of the mind. Kandel continued his work many years later and deciphered the fundamental biological processes in the brain. Freud gave him the impetus for his research.","eric-kandel.portrait_2.caption":"In 2000 the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine was awarded jointly to KANDEL alongside AVRID CARLSSON of Sweden and PAUL GREENGARD of the USA for their discoveries concerning signal transduction in the nervous system.","eric-kandel.portrait_2.copyright":"© Anders Wiklund/TT NewsAgency/picturedesk.com","eric-kandel.question_6":"When did you first start to deal with Freud?","eric-kandel.answer_6.1":"While I was at college I got to know Anna Kris, the daughter of Ernst Kris","eric-kandel.answer_6.2":"1","eric-kandel.question_7":"What was it about Freud’s work that fascinated you?","eric-kandel.answer_7":"Well, the whole idea of an unconscious mental life, the interpretation of dreams.

He wanted to stay, until it was clear that his life was in danger. Because he loved Vienna.","eric-kandel.paragraph_3":"Kandel and Vienna – a special relationship. He grew up at Severingasse 8 close to Berggasse and the Josephinum, which is synonymous with Vienna’s medical achieve-ments. The Belvedere with Schiele’s and Klimt’s pictures was not far away. With the National Socialists in power, Kandel fled to the USA with his family in 1939 at the age of ten.

Emperor Franz Joseph was on the way down and I think people felt that. Franz Joseph’s relationship with the Kaiser was very much balanced in Germany’s favor.

You know, if it wasn’t for him we would never have had a Zuckerkandl salon, where countless artists heard about the latest scientific discoveries. I think we have to put him in that mix. Let’s put it like this, he was very important.","eric-kandel.paragraph_4":"Praising Rokitansky – something Kandel likes to do. In his book The Age of Insight, he highlights the former's influence on the genesis of modern medicine. Born in Bohemia, Rokitansky was liberal, tolerant and cosmopolitan – and strongly oriented to fundamental scientific principles. He was an advocate of interdisciplinary collaboration, and never lost sight of patient needs. Kandel would also like to be remembered as a builder of bridges: between the disciplines that focus on the brain and the mind.","eric-kandel.question_18":"Where does the artists’ fascination for scientific insights stem from?

It was considered unseemly for females to display a level of education beyond that needed to make polite conversation over dinner. But the women of the nineteenth century also worked outside the family, albeit without any recognition in society: as handywomen, teachers, caregivers and – like Schnitzler’s “sweet girl with the pinpricked fingers” – in the factories of the constantly expanding capital. There was a vast gulf between reality and perception.","emanzipation.paragraph_2":"“The role of the woman was a construct that had nothing to do with reality,” comments University of Vienna historian Gabriella Hauch. “This societal role developed into a paradigm that was underpinned by various laws. In reality the lives women led were extremely varied – and that applied to illiterate day laborers, self-confident factory workers and the legions of servant girls in equal measure. And then there were the wives and daughters of well-heeled middle-class households and aristocratic circles. While paid work was a cursed necessity for some, for others it was an aspirational goal.” From this perspective, all women had a reason to improve their situation, and it was high time for this to actually happen.","emanzipation.portrait_3.caption.firstName":"Rosa","emanzipation.portrait_3.caption.lastName":"Mayreder","emanzipation.header_1":"Raising voices","emanzipation.paragraph_3":"Calls for equal rights were becoming ever louder and impossible to ignore.

Lang was an energetic, eloquent speaker and cofounder of the General Austrian Women’s Association, whose mission was to achieve universal suffrage and bring about equal rights for women.

Her real task was to draw up a guest list conducive to the creation of a menu that was flavorsome and nourishing, and spicy yet easily digestible. Esprit provided the basic ingredient, seasoned with scandals, affairs of the heart, political machinations and, above all, art. The whole composition was touched off with a subtle erotic note. Participants spoke openly, morals were called into question. One person who provided ample fuel for conversation was Alma Schindler, later Mahler, Gropius and Werfel (see box for details of Alma’s life of scandal). But even the liberalism of the era had its limits: Lina Loos (1882-1950), wife of the architect, had an affair with the 18-year-old son of her friend, which ended not only with the young man’s suicide but also led to her temporary exclusion from society. Ultimately though it was dramas like this that helped shake up established ideas.","emanzipation.paragraph_7":"Matters were always in keeping with standing in society in the salon run by Princess Nora Fugger (1864-1945).

          "Zuckerkandl and her divan","emanzipation.paragraph_8":"The imperial court, long the only society trendsetters, faced serious competition with the emergence of the political and artistic salons. One of the leading Viennese salonnières of the turn of the century was Berta Zuckerkandl (1864-1945). Her salon was held from 1917 onwards inside Palais Lieben-Auspitz by the Burgtheater. Today the building houses Café Landtmann. Zuckerkandl could usually be found seated on her long divan, surrounded by young painters, poets and musicians. Eloquent, charismatic and full of energy, she constantly expanded her influence. Significantly involved in the foundation of the Secession, she was not one to content herself with pulling strings in the background. She was simply far too colorful for the role of éminence grise. Her arch enemy Karl Kraus spitefully dismissed her as a “cultural windbag”.","emanzipation.paragraph_9":"In later years she was a committed pacifist and after her emigration she continued to work as a foreign correspondent.

However, Fleischmann refused to be cowed by scandal. When the Second World War put an end to her livelihood, she regrouped and built up a studio in Manhattan. Today her pictures can be found on display in some of the world’s leading museums. Trained at the court opera, dancer Grete Wiesenthal (1885-1970) was another individual who wanted more than society was prepared to give her, and she ended up founding her own ballet school so that she could realize her artistic vision without making compromises.","emanzipation.paragraph_13":"Viennese actress Hedy Kiesler (1914-2000), who enjoyed a great career in America under the name of Hedy Lamarr, was even more focused on personal success. Fêted as the most beautiful woman in the world she was a goddess of the silver screen, a style icon and cover girl before the days of Monroe.","emanzipation.paragraph_14":"Her entrance to Hollywood was mired in controversy: Lamarr’s nude scene and insinuated female orgasm in the film Ecstasy had the German censors up in arms. It wasn’t until much later that the general public discovered there was much more to Lamarr than the glamorous screen siren. She was one of the inventors of a frequency hopping system for the remote control of torpedoes, and developed a patent that is in use to this day in Bluetooth technology. However, this particular invention was rooted in the desire for personal revenge: her first husband, an arms dealer who worked for the Nazis, held her as a virtual prisoner for many years.","emanzipation.paragraph_15":"Fashion designer Emilie Flöge (1874-1952) was also a self-reliant woman. A successful businesswoman, she ran a flourishing haute couture salon with her sisters, at times employing up to 80 seamstresses.

Before marrying her, the composer Gustav Mahler (1860-1911) sent Alma Schindler (1879-1964), who was 19 years his junior, a 20-page letter in which he made it clear that she was only to live for him from that point on and would have to bury her own ambitions. Alma was also a composer and by all accounts not a bad one at all. But that was of no interest to him. She accepted her fate, until the next luminary entered her life. Was she in love with the art or the artist? This question continues to provide her biographers with food for thought to this day. The fact is that the list of her lovers and husbands is as impressive as their talents were undeniable. Inspired by Alma the muse, their genius came to the fore. The painter Kokoschka, the architect Gropius, and the much younger writer Franz Werfel: Alma survived them all and described them – not always showing mercy – in her memoirs. She cruelly listed their physical shortcomings and human weaknesses, not even stopping short of making ill-advised politically-charged racial remarks. Her increasingly sympathetic views on National Socialism soon gave the lie to the image she had carefully constructed for herself. Behind the facade of the self-sacrificing muse was a promiscuous, small-minded woman who was driven by craven ambition.

And so it was: In the second half of the 19th century Vienna went down a special route all of its own, transforming itself into the intellectual andartistic center of the world. But how? The revolutions of 1848 left Vienna relatively unscathed from a democratic point of view. Led by the conservative emperor Franz Joseph, the Habsburgs were firmly in control. The nobility and the clergy held the reins. By 1910 immigrants had flocked to Vienna from all over the Dual Monarchy, forming a multinational, multilingual and multicultural city with a population of more than two million. The last major military campaign came in 1866 (which, like so many before, the Habsburgs lost): the Battle of Königgrätz. From that point on, the Habsburgs “only” held sway over their own Dual Monarchy. A period of peace followed. The 1860s saw full civil rights conferred on the Jewish population. Like the nobility and clergy, they were able to acquire plots of land to build on and would go on to become influential patrons of the arts.\nFollowing the 1867 constitutional reforms, the liberals found themselves at the political helm. The stock exchange crash of 9 May 1873 brought their first major setback. And in 1879 they were defeated in parliamentary elections. The conservatives, led by Count Eduard Taaffe, stepped into the breech.","protagonisten.footnotes_1":"Lothar Machtan: Die Abdankung.

The neuroscientist and Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel, who emigrated from Vienna to the USA with his parents in 1939, would later make the following apposite observation: “Indeed Viennese life at the turn of the century provided opportunities in salons and coffeehouses for scientists, writers and artists to come together in an atmosphere that was at once inspiring, optimistic, and politically engaged.”","protagonisten.paragraph_3.2":"2","protagonisten.paragraph_3b":"Carl E.

Soldiers could also be met at Vienna’s numerous public bathhouses, albeit without money necessarily changing hands. The Roman baths in the city’s second district of Leopoldstadt, like the Centralbad (now the exclusively gay Kaiserbründl Sauna, which counted none other than Emperor Franz Joseph’s brother Archduke Ludwig Victor, aka Luziwuzi, among its patrons), were known far beyond the city as a sophisticated meeting place for gay men. The less high-stationed had to make do with the proletarian Margaretenbad or Esterházybad, both of which were close to Naschmarkt.

Vienna was one of the centers, if not the center, of scientific discourse on the subject of homosexuality. Medicine, the nascent discipline of sexual research, and the various fledgling schools of thought in psychology found a particularly rewarding task in coming up with explanations for the phenomenon of homosexuality. “Pscyhopathia sexualis” by Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing was not only the subject of intense discussion in coffeehouses and scientific circles. The best-selling tome, which went through 13 print runs before Krafft-Ebing’s death, owed its global reputation not only to “the interest of its content [...] that overheated novel readers gleaned from his teaching of the sexual perversions” as Karl Kraus pointedly put it. Putting all the criticism of Krafft-Ebing’s pathologizing basic theories to one side, his Psychopathia continues to shape the way we talk and think about sexuality to this day, as some of the terms popularized or coined by him, such as sadism and masochism, or the way that he presented different forms of fetishism have anchored themselves deep in the collective psyche.","gay-vienna.paragraph_6.1":"Only one other man would eclipse his worldwide influence: Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, believed that people had innate bisexual tendencies and that heterosexual or homosexual libidinal drives only emerged in the course of development. And although Freudian theory saw homosexuality as a deficit in sexual development, he, like Krafft-Ebing and many other leading intellectuals of his day – such as the writers Karl Kraus and Stefan Zweig, or women’s rights campaigner Rosa Mayreder – was opposed to the criminalization of homosexuality.","gay-vienna.paragraph_6.2":"Many of them underestimated the forces of conservatism, and the rise of fascism, which put an end to all their efforts. A short time later the National Socialist regime would punish homosexuals with lengthy jail sentences, condemn them to concentration camps and perform experiments on their bodies. Even after their release, the threat of imprisonment and widespread condemnation by society continued to hang over them. It would take until 1971 before homosexual acts between consenting adults were no longer punishable by law. And any hopes of a new dawn for a homosexual subculture as seen in turn-of-the-century Vienna were then still a long way off.","gay-vienna.portrait_5.caption":"Esterházybad, ca. 1905 © Zentrum QWIEN","gewagte-kunst.title.first-line":"100 years old.
